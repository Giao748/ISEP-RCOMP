## 2. Subtasks Assessment

### 2.1. 1211895 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 1, encompassing the campus backbone.
Integration of every member's Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation.

**Status:** Building 1: Totally implemented with no issues.
**Backbone:** To be implemented, not tested yet, although our professor has not demanded it yet.

### 2.2. 1190378 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 2, encompassing the campus backbone.

**Status:** Totally implemented with no issues.

### 2.3. 1220672 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 3, encompassing the campus backbone.

**Status:** Totally implemented with no issues.

### 2.4. 1220741 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 4, encompassing the campus backbone.

**Status:** Totally implemented with no issues.

## 3 - Retrospective

### What Went Well:

- **Team Cohesion and Support:** The team demonstrated more cohesion and mutual support throughout the sprint, which facilitated smoother progress and problem-solving.
- **Communication of Results:** Although communication was not our strongest point, it was precise, and results were shared along with its team member help.

### Areas for Improvement:

- **Communication:** While the communication of results was effective, the overall communication could be enhanced. More consistent and frequent updates would help in maintaining alignment and ensuring that all team members are on the same page.
- **Work Consistency:** The consistency of work across different parts of the project was as expected, peaking mostly around the project submission date.

#### Our team believes our project deserves a better grade, to therefore achieve stronger results:

In this sprint, we did not have critical mistakes like the last, in which our team **did not have** proper planning (**_planning.md_**) or a review (**_review.md_**).

There was also a misunderstanding in team communication which led the group not to add **copper cable redundancy** on the campus backbone.

In this project, on the other hand, all team members followed the [sprint planning](planning.md) established rules. Therefore, we believe there were no critical mistakes as in the last.
