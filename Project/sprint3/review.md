**Status:** Totally implemented with no issues.

## 3 - Retrospective

### What Went Well:

- **Perseverance:** Despite a challenging start to the project, the team demonstrated significant perseverance and hard work throughout the sprint, ultimately achieving a satisfactory end result.
- **Patience:** Rather than giving up on the progress when encountering difficulties, the team maintained its efforts and eventually discovered a solution.

### Areas for Improvement:

- **Communication:** Communication was less frequent and less clear compared to the previous sprint. This was partly due to the team being on "vacation" during the "Queima das Fitas" week, which led to reduced engagement as members were either partying or resting.
- **Work Consistency:** Similar to the previous sprint, work consistency declined, exacerbated by the additional challenges mentioned above.

### Sprint Performance Evaluation

Our team believes our project deserves either the same or slightly worse grade than the last sprint, as we maintained our strong results:

**Consistency Maintained from the Last Sprint:**

- **Reduction in Critical Mistakes:** This sprint, like the last, was free from critical errors. Previously, our team lacked proper planning and review documentation (referenced in `planning.md` and `review.md`), issues that were not repeated this time.

- **Proper use of Sprint Planning:** As on the last sprint, team members consistently followed the established [sprint planning](planning.md) rules, ensuring no critical mistakes occurred as in the previous sprint.

**Achievements of This Sprint:**
We successfully met all specified requirements, including:
- Dynamic routing
- Pings and telephone communications within and between buildings
- NAT and ACL configurations for each building
